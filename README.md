## Inspiration
ArTailor was inspired by controversies over the use of AI for art and GenAI threatening human artists. We wanted to be able to show that AI can and should be used as a tool to help artists, instead of entirely replacing them. 

Our intention is to use ControlNet (OpenPose, LineArt, MLSD) software to help artists compare their drawings' anatomy to their references. Besides ControlNet image processing, we also plan on this websits consolidating other tools to help artists, such as color palette generators and color matchers.

We demonstrate the usage of ControlNet in the ArTailor.ipynb file, which can also be viewed using the Google Colab link.

While we weren't able to build a prototype of the working website, we did create a design plan for the user interface.

## Reflection/Next Steps
It was difficult at first to figure out how to allow users to upload files, but we were able to overcome that and provide options for URLs/direct uploads. 

From this project, we learned more about the capabilities of AI and how they should be taken into consideration when creating AI tools. All four of us are relatively new to Hackathons and creating independent projects, so this was a good learning experience overall. 

We are thinking of fully developing this project in the future with more time, as we are genuinely passionate about using AI as a tool for artists rather than something to replace them entirely. 

# Google Colab Disclaimers
Sometimes the image may fail to load if selecting an image from your files- this is likely due to the uploaded file size or browser issues. Please try again with a smaller, or use a URL instead

# Image Compare Disclaimer
Please make sure to run the following commands in terminal before: 
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install numpy
- pip install Pillow
  
If that doesnt work still, then run these commands in terminal:
- python3 -m pip install opencv-python
- python3 -m pip install numpy 
- python3 -m pip install Pillow
